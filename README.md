# Something is wrong here

If we don't ship our flagship Enterprise FizzBuzz project soon we're in trouble. We absolutely need to go live before we've burnt through all our funding, but therr are failing tests.

If I checkout the code and type

```
mvn test
```

Then `CompoundListenerTest` fails.

Our mission critical business logic must be broken!!!!!!!

If we ship it we'll be a laughing stock. Arrrrgh.

But when I run `CompoundListenerTest` in my IDE it passes.

Please somebody tell me what is going on.
